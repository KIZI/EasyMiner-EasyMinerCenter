# ConfirmationDialog

ConfirmationDialog is a component for the [Nette Framework][nette], that
provides comfortable handling of actions that need to be confirmed by the user.
Thanks to the revolutionary feature of dynamic events it can be easily used in
other components such as the DataGrid. Complete AJAX support is a matter of
course.
